## Day 3!

#### Main learning points in Day 3:
- String PARSING in C :open_mouth:
  - Learnt about the `regex.h` library in C.
  - Learnt about how hard it is. Also I need to work on my regex.
  - :exclamation_mark: Can someone explain to me why `\\d` doesn't regex properly
  but `[0-9]` does?

#### Could be done better:
- There's probably a better way to manage the memory. Not sure how else I would use this.
- I need to start thinking more about performance

#### Todo:
- Modularise the regexer for future use. Esp when the inputs are weirder.
