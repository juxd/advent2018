## Day 2

#### Main learning points in day 2:
- String reading & storage in C.
  - Learnt a lot about how to read input well, and how to manage new lines (Thanks Nick!)
  - Learnt about dangers of not `malloc`-ing/explicitly declaring size for array (Thanks Sean!)
  - How to approach variable length storage in C?

- Miscellaneous C
  - Learn to use LLDB (GDB alternative for MacOS)

#### Could be done better:
  - Magic numbers!
  - Is there a better way to "reset" (zero out) memory region after use?
  - More debug lines! need to make this a habit

#### Possible to-dos:
- [ ] Experiment with global variables for string scanning (regarding different
  segfault scenarios despite identical code)
- [ ] Look up how I accidentally printed runtime information with `printf` - segmentation in macOS runtime
